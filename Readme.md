**This is the Patakeros team (group 061) repository for the 3rd semester Integrative Project.**

In this project, our team will be developing a solution that supports the management of a company responsible for running an agricultural facility following an organic production method.

This project works as a proof-of-concept and covers a set of critical aspects in the management of an agricultural holding in Organic Production, namely:
* management of plots (fields);
* crops;
* irrigation;
* marketing of products;
* networked agriculture;
* management of information collected from soil and meteorological sensors;
* sizing and use of agricultural warehouses requiring controlled temperatures.
